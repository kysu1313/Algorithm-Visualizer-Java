# Algorithm-Visualizer-Java
Personal project I made using JavaFX to visualize various types of sorting and path-finding algorithms.
The sorting algorithms are working properly. The path finding algorithms are still being worked on. 

A* Path-Finding Algorithm

Quick Sort Algorithm:

Here is an example of Heap Sort: (sorry, I know the flashing is a bit annoying, I'll fix the colors)
